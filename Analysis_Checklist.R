# Determine Core microbiome

# Look at Ben's papers to see how to define it and get ideas for analyses

# Does core microbiome change for different species? 

# Does core microbiome change for different genotypes?

# Then, find core microbiome between BOTH coral species:
#   Look at that against biogeography


# Manuscript needs to have standalone merit on P luteus data. Use comparison to bolster any
# arguments made

# So, compare core microbiome of P luteus, P acuta, and find shared members
